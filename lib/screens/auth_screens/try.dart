//    Try Catch

//    In Flutter, error handling is crucial for creating
//    robust and reliable applications.
//    The try-catch statement is a fundamental
//    construct for managing exceptions,
//    allowing developers to gracefully handle
//    errors during the execution of their code.

a() {
  try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
  } catch (error) {
    // Code to handle the exception
  } finally {
    // Code that will be executed whether an exception is thrown or not
  }
}
